## Project Overview

South Africa has a rich road events culture, from the iconic Comrades Marathon to the Cape Town Cycle Tour and hundreds of community park runs. However, many of these events are still managed through paper-based registration and disconnected spreadsheets.

**RaceDay** is a full-stack web-based event management system designed specifically for the South African road running, walking, and cycling community. This repository contains the **planning and database foundation** (Part 1) for the project, including the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), API endpoint specifications, and the SQL database schema.

##  User Roles

The system supports two distinct user roles, each with specific permissions:

###  Organiser
- Create, edit, and delete events.
- Define age and distance categories for events.
- View all participant enrolments for their events.
- Capture and publish finish times and finishing positions.

###  Participant
- Register and manage their personal profile.
- Browse upcoming events with filtering options.
- Enrol in events by selecting a relevant category.
- View their personal enrolment history and race results.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (Part 1)

Since Part 1 focuses on planning and database design, the "setup" involves verifying the database script and reviewing the documentation.

**Prerequisites:**
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.
- SQL Server (LocalDB, Express, or Full instance).

**Steps to run the Database Script:**

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omph1l3/RaceDayDB.git
    cd RaceDayDB
